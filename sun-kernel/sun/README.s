; you probably have a lot of questions
; - Why is this OS assembly?
; - Why is the code so terrible?
; - Why is the readme literally an asm file?
; - Can I use C?
; - would C not be more pratical?
; i will answer all of these questions
;
; #1 why is this OS in assembly?
; cause i felt like it
;
; #2 why is the code so terrible?
; when looking through the code you'll find
; many bad practices. thats because i dont
; care about good code i care about it working.
;
; #3 why is the readme assembly
; markdown is overrated
;
; #4 can i use C
; the fact you are asking if you can use C
; with an assembly project tells me you are
; not experienced enough in C to deserve an
; answer. lookup inline asm.
;
; #5 would C not be more practical?
; yes, refer to question one.
; edit - unfortunately assembly was too impractical so now we use C :(
;
; for compilation and all that stuff, go to
; docs.md.
